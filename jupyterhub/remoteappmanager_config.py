# # Docker realm is used to identify the containers that are managed by this
# # particular instance of simphony-remote. It will be the first entry in
# # the container name, and will also be added as part of a run-time container
# # label. You generally should not change this unless you have multiple
# # installations of simphony-remote all using the same docker host.

# # TLS configuration
# # -----------------

# # Set this to True to enable TLS connection with the docker client

# # Enables verification of the certificates. By default, this is the
# # result of the DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY envvar. Set to False to skip verification/
#
# tls_verify = True
#
# # Full paths of the CA certificate, certificate and key of the docker
# # machine. Normally these are computed from the DOCKER_CERT_PATH.
# # If you want to use a recognised CA for verification, set the tls_ca to
# # an empty string
